Otherwise some gardening tools would have been a good present. Anyway, there's a flower show in town soon. We could get her a ticket to go there.</p>
                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Sounds more exciting than my other suggestion, a big plant.</p>

I know I've run in those conditions before, but luckily for me it's not going to be like that. But I'm still wondering if the race will go ahead even after the early morning mist has cleared.

Three trains actually, so I was worried one would be late and I'd miss the others, but I managed to avoid that. The thing was, I hadn't realized two were commuter trains. They were packed. On the second one I stood up for an hour. Not great as I was really tired. Knowing me, though, I'd probably make the same mistake again.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 1:</span> I'm currently focusing on specific environmental aspects of Cuckoo Park. For example, the lakes there attract birds, but these places need looking after as the water can dry up during hot summers. So I work with the local environmental agency to prevent that. Bird populations everywhere need our help, partly because of pollution, so volunteers do things like building shelters for them in our park.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 1:</span> When I found out about a plan for more parking spaces, I knew I had to do something to stop it, as it meant losing part of Cuckoo Park. Given how easy it is to reach the park on public transport or by bike, I felt it wasn't really required, even though it wasn't going to be expensive. At least they planned to build them behind some trees, so the park would have been almost as quiet as it is now.</p>

                <p>For my birthday, my friend took me to my first classical concert. To be honest, I didn't look at the evening's program in advance, so I didn't realize that what the orchestra was going to play would be totally unfamiliar to me. Anyway, it didn't matter. It was beautiful and our seats couldn't have been any nearer to the stage. But the pianist, a big name in the music world, didn't look quite as impressive as I'd Expected, somehow.</p>

                <p>Being at a classical music concert was a great experience, but a strange one too. For example, I realised it's forbidden to clap after a really good bit. You're supposed to wait until right at the end, even if the musicians have played one part brilliantly. A little confusing, really. Anyway, I put on my best silk suit, as I'd been advised to, luckily. And there are tickets available for another performance next month, so we may go again.</p>

                <p>We got seats near the front, even though the musician performing was world famous. I wasn't really into a couple of the pieces she played, but the rest was awesome. And some people sitting nearby were almost as interesting as events on stage. They'd brought written copies of the music and were following those. I didn't understand that. Why not just enjoy the music? Anyway, it was a great experience, but I'm unsure whether I'd rush to book another event.</p>

                <p>I was aware before the concert that there were some things I shouldn't do, like making a noise during the performance, obviously. And actually everyone was super quiet then. But when it was over, they all just stood up, clapping, whistling and shouting. I'd never seen anything like it. Awful. It was an amazing performance, though, even if I wasn't that familiar with some pieces they played. But then, all classical music sounds fantastic to me.</p>

                <p>Classical concerts always look so formal on TV, and everyone seems to know exactly what to do, so I thought I'd feel nervous. Luckily, I got a few tips before I went, although I forgot to ask how I was supposed to dress. So I just copied what I'd seen on TV and more or less got it right. Our tickets meant we ended up a long way from the stage, though, so we missed out on the atmosphere, really.</p>

                <p>I was convinced I wouldn't enjoy the concert I went to. Classical music's not my thing, really. Even so, I found out a little about the star violinist who was playing and what he'd play. Stuff I'd heard of, at least. Anyway, once I got inside the whole experience, the front row seats, the lights, the orchestra so amazed me that by the time I left, I'd already booked to see something else the following week.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 1:</span> I'm with Harry Soames, who recently joined a group boat trip along a river. Harry, tell us about your trip. What were your boats like?</p>
                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Well, we each had our own small inflatable boat. You pump it full of air to use and you can pack it up and carry it to quiet areas of water away from other people. You can't reach the same speed as with some other boats, but they're great to use. Not many people know about them yet, though.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Well, I was keen to keep going until the river reached the sea, although that was unrealistic, as we only had three days. So we let that set the limit as to how far we could get. And we knew if we reached a place where the water became dangerously fast flowing, we might have to turn back or walk along the bank for a bit.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Yeah, David and Ben, who clearly both loved their job. And even though I didn't live that far away, they had a much greater familiarity with the place. I'd probably done as much on water as they had, though, like windsurfing and sailing and those sports had taught me how to keep clothes and stuff dry in a waterproof bag while you're on water. Very useful for the trip.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Yes, our guides took us right to the very top of the river valley where we could look down and see where were heading. We took a few pictures, although it was impossible to capture the beauty of it. But I was also keen to actually follow the river all the way back to where it began, from a lake nearby. So I did that before I joined the group. I'd guessed there'd be no opportunity later on.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Wonderful. So quiet and calm after all the rush of the preparations. And we got to stretches of river that are much easier to reach if you've got a boat, Although, in fact, there were still more walkers around than I'd expected. And I guess I'd imagined being able to see for miles, although the views were occasionally blocked by overhanging trees. But the trip was definitely still worth it.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 1:</span> But eventually the river became rocky and unsafe for your boats, so you got out and walked, is that right?</p>
                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Yes, through the nearby town. That was weird. It was so noisy and very different from what we'd left. I thought we might miss out on some of the animals and birds too, although our guides assured us that wasn't the case. Even so, I was keen to get back and carry on learning as much as I could about the river.</p>

                <p><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span> Well, I can't say our tents were great. I felt tired during the day from lack of sleep. I was so relieved though that the whole group got on so well together. That doesn't always happen. And it didn't rain, although it wasn't that warm. But then travelling in the heat would have been difficult.</p>

And I was glad of my thick sweater and socks then too. The thing was though, were only given freeze dried meals which we could carry easily and they weren't that tasty.
